# MNIST Digit Recognition
There are images of digits 0 to 9 and have labels associated with each image.
Processing:
  Check the version of Tensorflow and Keras
  Load training and test data including labels
  Normalize the images
  Plot few images after being normalized
  Create a Neural Network and build a model
  Train the model on the training dataset
  Evaluate the accuracy of the model using test dataset
  Plot the accuracy and loss for the model
  Introduction to tensorflow "Callbacks"
